Weather Dashboard Project
My project for the Internshala JavaScript training. I built this to practice fetching data from a live API and displaying it in a clean, user-friendly way. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!

Core Features:
Live Weather Search: By city name or your current location.
5-Day Forecast: See what the weather will be like for the next few days.
Dynamic Backgrounds: The background image changes based on the weather (Sunny, Rain, etc.).
Recent Searches: A list of your last 5 searches for quick access.
Smart Error Handling: The app won't crash if you search for a city that doesn't exist.


Built With:
HTML,
Tailwind CSS,
Vanilla JavaScript,
WeatherAPI.com.


How to Run It
Clone the project.
Get a free API key from WeatherAPI.com.
Open script.js and paste your API key into the API_KEY variable at the top.
Open index.html in your browser. That's it!


What I Learned
This was a great exercise in working with a real-world API. Figuring out how to handle both successful data and different kinds of errors was the biggest challenge and the most valuable lesson for me.
I also learned how to use AI as a programming assistant. It was a useful tool for helping me debug some tough spots and for brainstorming when I got stuck, which let me focus on understanding the core logic of the application.
